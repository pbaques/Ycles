 Ycles: a smaller project, to develop in parallel with DMCS-WEBSHARES, which is my main project
 Ycles will be a minor project and an opportunity to try different languages to accomplish various 
 tasks around Numerycles, an innovative math, technology and leadership program I started in 2002 
 and have taken to seven countries.
 
 Initially, I will develop here the first step of the program, the generation of a "Necklace". 
 A Necklace is a sequence of digits that stems from the first two (arbitraryly chosen fron 1 - 9, no zero's)
 by adding the last and before last two digits. If the sum is more than one digit its digits are added 
 until only one remains. The Necklace "closes" when the initial, arbitrary two digits reappear.
